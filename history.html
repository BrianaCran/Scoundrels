                    Blackbeard was a famous pirate from England who operated around the West Indies and
                    the Eastern coast of the American colonies. He was thought to be born in Bristol, England.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He was also known as Edward Teach and he was thought to have been a sailor or privateer during
                    <span class="specialT">Queen Anne's War</span> before settling down in the town of New Providence.
                    Eventually, he captured a French warship and renamed it <span class="specialT"> Queen Anne's Revenge</span>.
                 </p>
                 <p>He pillaged and pirated off the East coast for years until he was taken down in battle by a small group of soldiers led <body>
                    Lt. Robert Maynard.

                        <h2>Stede Bonnet </h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Bonnet was an 18th century Barbadian pirate who was sometimes called the "Gentleman Pirate". He was a surprisingly decent landowner
                          before he turned to a life of piracy. He bought a vessel and named it <span class="specialT"> Revenge</span> and traveled with his paid crew along the Eatern
                          Seaboard where he captured and plundered other ships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          While setting sail for the haven of pirates, located in Nassau, Bahamas, he encountered a Spanish warship
                          and was seriously wounded. But, he managed to make it to Nassau where he met Blackbeard and they teamed up until Bonnet got his own ship again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Bonnet ended up being pardoned by the governor of North Carolina and so he not only changed his name to Thomas, but also changed his ship name
                          to <span class="specialT">Royal James</span>.
                          Eventually, Colonel William Rhett led a naval expedition against Bonnet and his men. They fought for hours and in the end Bonnet was captured.
                          He was tried and hanged in Charleston, SC.

                            <p>Jack was an English pirate operating in Cuba and the Bahamas during the "Golden Age" of piracy which ran from 1650 to 1730.

                              He is remembered for having developed the skull and crossed swords flag and for also having two female crew memebers. The two women
                              were Mary Read and his lover Anne Bonny.

                              He continued plundering until 1720 when he was captured by pirate hunter Jonathan Barnet
                              and hanged in Port Royal Jamaica.
